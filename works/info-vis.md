# Information Visualization

In Fall 2018, I did an independent study on information visualization under the guidance of [Professor Iris Howley](http://cs.williams.edu/~iris). I wrote a [weekly blog](https://www.lester-lee.com/f2018-info-vis/) in which I documented my progress.

This is the description of the course:

People have access to an increasingly staggering amount of information, and one way of processing such vast amounts of data is through visualization. This independent study will delve into the field of information visualization and understand in detail how visualization can be used to explore and explain complex data. I will learn the principles behind information visualization, how to evaluate and critically critique visualizations, and how to transform datasets into effective visualizations.
