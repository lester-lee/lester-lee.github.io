In January 2017, I took a class taught by [Chris Warren](https://github.com/cwarren) on Roguelike games.

[Gus Beirne](https://github.com/gusbeirne) and I worked together on creating [down to the wire](https://www.lester-lee.com/down-to-the-wire/).

You play as the AI of a spaceship who must use its two remaining drones to scavenge randomly generated worlds for parts. Each part of a drone has its own functionality, and losing a part is costly and deadly.

This game can be played at [http://www.lester-lee.com/down-to-the-wire](http://www.lester-lee.com/down-to-the-wire).\\
It is a basic Rougelike game implemented in Javascript using the [ROT.js library](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/).

The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/lester-lee/down-to-the-wire).
