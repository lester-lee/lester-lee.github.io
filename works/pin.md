# PIN&#8253;

[![PIN: Who Knows What Where?]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/works/pin/preview.png)](http://www.lester-lee.com/curious-places/)

During Spring 2018, I took a [Human Computer Interaction](https://sites.google.com/williams.edu/csci376-2018/) course at Williams College with Professor [Iris Howley](http://cs.williams.edu/~iris/).

I worked together with [Alyssa Wang](https://alyssawang.github.io/csci376/) and [Karl Bocker](https://karlbocker.github.io/) on a project in which we designed a mobile application for location-based curiosity satisfaction: [PIN&#8253;](http://www.lester-lee.com/curious-places/).

[The PIN website](http://www.lester-lee.com/curious-places/) showcases our design and documents our process.
