# Explore WCMA

[![Preview of Explore WCMA visualization]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/works/explore-wcma/preview.png)](https://www.lester-lee.com/wcma-viz/)

During Fall 2018, I did an independent study on the theory, implementation, and evaluation of data visualizations under the guidance of Professor [Iris Howley](http://cs.williams.edu/~iris). You can find more information about my work at [my blog](https://www.lester-lee.com/f2018-info-vis/).

The semester culminated in [Explore WCMA (Williams College Museum of Art)](https://www.lester-lee.com/wcma-viz/), which is a visualization that aims to aid the exploration of pieces in the WCMA collection. Much thanks to [WCMA](https://github.com/wcmaart/collection) for providing me with data and helping me out with this project!

The code for the visualization is available on [Github](https://github.com/lester-lee/wcma-viz).
