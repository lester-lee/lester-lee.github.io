In Fall 2018, I took an art class with [Zak Arctander](). For my final projection, I created [projection](), an art piece in the style of top-down RPG games.

[projection]() explores the constructive and deconstructive nature of language; in what ways do we build worlds with narration? In what ways do we deconstruct worlds? What does our speech project onto the world around us? What place do we have in a world that is constructed by language? How do we cope?

The player will get a chance to walk through several different scenes and interact with each presented setting.

Use the arrow keys to move and `j` to interact with the world.

The code is available on [Github]().
